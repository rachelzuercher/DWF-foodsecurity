## Abstract:
Governments around the world have identified distant water fleets (DWFs) as a key threat to the health of marine ecosystems, domestic economic opportunities, and food security. With a high prevalence of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in countries where DWFs operate, the aquatic, animal-sourced foods caught by DWFs represent a vital opportunity to shift policy and improve global nutrition outcomes. To better understand this issue, we first conducted a literature review and expert interviews to develop a framework of relationships among DWFs and food and nutrition security. We then applied the framework to three unique case studies to describe the mechanisms underlying DWF-food security relationships. Our findings in the cases of neritic tunas in Madagascar, round scad in the Philippines, and jumbo flying squid in Peru highlight the potential for diverse policy pathways to improve food and nutritional outcomes. Importantly, access and utilization, two pillars of food security, emerged as essential dimensions for assessing impacts of DWFs and places where more information could significantly improve our understanding. This research suggests that integrating food systems expertise and nutrition metrics into management discussions and licensing negotiations can serve to illuminate the true tradeoffs of DWF access and steer DWF policy in a way best-suited to ensure an equitable flow of benefits to local communities.
